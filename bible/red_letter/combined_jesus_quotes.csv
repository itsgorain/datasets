Matthew,12,25,Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:,40
Matthew,12,26,"And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?",40
Matthew,12,27,"And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out?",10
Matthew,12,27,therefore they shall be your judges.,43
Matthew,12,28,"But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.",22
Matthew,12,29,"Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man?",37
Matthew,12,29,and then he will spoil his house.,47
Matthew,12,30,He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad.,11
Matthew,12,31,"Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.",2
Matthew,12,32,"And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come.",5
Matthew,12,33,"Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit.",49
Matthew,12,34,"O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things?",10
Matthew,12,34,for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.,10
Matthew,12,35,A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.,49
Matthew,12,36,"But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.",2
Matthew,12,37,"For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.",17
Matthew,12,39,"An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:",45
Matthew,12,40,For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.,5
Matthew,12,41,"The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.",20

Matthew,12,44,"Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.",47
Matthew,12,45,"Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.",47

Matthew,12,48,Who is my mother?,20
Matthew,12,48,and who are my brethren?,43

Matthew,13,3,"Behold, a sower went forth to sow;",47
Matthew,13,4,"And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:",47
Matthew,13,5,"Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:",47
Matthew,13,6,"And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.",47
Matthew,13,7,"And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:",49
Matthew,13,8,"But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.",49
Matthew,13,9,"Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.",12
Matthew,13,11,"Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.",22
Matthew,13,12,"For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath.",11
Matthew,13,13,"Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.",10
Matthew,13,14,"And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:",30
Matthew,13,15,"For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.",10
Matthew,13,16,"But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.",43
Matthew,13,17,"For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.",2
Matthew,13,18,Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.,10
Matthew,13,19,"When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart.",10
Matthew,13,19,This is he which received seed by the way side.,10
Matthew,13,20,"But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;",11
Matthew,13,21,"Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.",10
Matthew,13,22,"He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.",33
Matthew,13,23,"But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.",49
Matthew,13,24,The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:,22
Matthew,13,25,"But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.",47
Matthew,13,26,"But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.",49
Matthew,13,27,"So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field?",17
Matthew,13,27,from whence then hath it tares?,20
Matthew,13,28,"He said unto them, An enemy hath done this.",47
Matthew,13,28,"The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?",17
Matthew,13,29,"But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.",30
Matthew,13,30,"Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn.",10
Matthew,13,31,"The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:",22
Matthew,13,32,"Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.",10
Matthew,13,33,"The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.",22
Matthew,13,37,He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;,5
Matthew,13,38,The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;,43
Matthew,13,39,The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.,33
Matthew,13,40,As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.,33
Matthew,13,41,"The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;",5
Matthew,13,42,And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.,29
Matthew,13,43,Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.,22
Matthew,13,43,"Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.",12
Matthew,13,44,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.",22
Matthew,13,45,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:",22
Matthew,13,46,"Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.",47
Matthew,13,47,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:",22
Matthew,13,48,"Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.",47
Matthew,13,49,"So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,",33
Matthew,13,50,And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.,29
Matthew,13,51,Have ye understood all these things?,1

Matthew,14,27,Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.,13
Matthew,14,29,Come.,47
Matthew,14,31,"O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?",17
Matthew,15,3,Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?,3
Matthew,15,4,"For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.",13
Matthew,15,5,"But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;",20
Matthew,15,6,"And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free.",20
Matthew,15,6,Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.,10
Matthew,15,7,"Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,",8
Matthew,15,8,"This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.",10
Matthew,15,9,"But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.",10

Matthew,15,13,"Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.",10
Matthew,15,14,Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind.,10
Matthew,15,14,"And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.",10
Matthew,15,16,Are ye also yet without understanding?,3
Matthew,15,17,"Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?",10
Matthew,15,18,But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.,10
Matthew,15,19,"For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:",10
Matthew,15,20,These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.,43
Matthew,15,24,I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.,34
Matthew,15,26,"It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.",10
Matthew,15,28,"O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt.",17
Matthew,15,32,"I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.",47
Matthew,15,34,How many loaves have ye?,41
Matthew,16,2,"When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.",10
Matthew,16,3,"And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering.",10
Matthew,16,3,"O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?",10
Matthew,16,4,"A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.",45
Matthew,16,6,Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.,10

Matthew,16,9,"Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?",41
Matthew,16,10,"Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?",41
Matthew,16,11,"How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?",20
Matthew,16,13,Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?,5
Matthew,16,15,But whom say ye that I am?,7
Matthew,16,17,"Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.",39
Matthew,16,18,"And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.",17

Matthew,16,23,"Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.",17
Matthew,16,24,"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.",13
Matthew,16,25,For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.,25
Matthew,16,26,"For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?",20
Matthew,16,26,or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?,20
Matthew,16,27,For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.,5
Matthew,16,28,"Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.",2

Matthew,17,17,"O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you?",23
Matthew,17,17,how long shall I suffer you?,23
Matthew,17,17,bring him hither to me.,11
Matthew,17,20,"Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.",2
Matthew,17,21,Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.,10
Matthew,17,22,The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:,5
Matthew,17,23,"And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again.",13
Matthew,17,25,"What thinkest thou, Simon?",17
Matthew,17,25,of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute?,20
Matthew,17,25,"of their own children, or of strangers?",20
Matthew,17,26,Then are the children free.,43
Matthew,17,27,"Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.",17
Matthew,18,3,"Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.",2
Matthew,18,4,"Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.",22
Matthew,18,5,And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.,11
Matthew,18,6,"But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.",47
Matthew,18,7,Woe unto the world because of offences!,6
Matthew,18,7,for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!,10
Matthew,18,8,"Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.",32
Matthew,18,9,"And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.",32
Matthew,18,10,"Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven.",39
Matthew,18,11,For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.,5
Matthew,18,12,How think ye?,3
Matthew,18,12,"if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?",47
Matthew,18,13,"And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.",2
Matthew,18,14,"Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.",39
Matthew,18,15,"Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.",17
Matthew,18,16,"But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.",10
Matthew,18,17,"And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.",47
Matthew,18,18,"Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.",2
Matthew,18,19,"Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.",39

Matthew,18,22,"I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven.",10
Matthew,18,23,"Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants.",22
Matthew,18,24,"And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents.",47
Matthew,18,25,"But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.",47
Matthew,18,26,"The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.",8
Matthew,18,27,"Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.",47
Matthew,18,28,"But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.",47
Matthew,18,29,"And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.",8
Matthew,18,30,"And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt.",47
Matthew,18,31,"So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.",47
Matthew,18,32,"Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:",17
Matthew,18,33,"Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?",17
Matthew,18,34,"And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him.",47
Matthew,18,35,"So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.",30
Matthew,19,4,"Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,",10
Matthew,19,5,"And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?",47
Matthew,19,6,"Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh.",43
Matthew,19,6,"What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.",13
Matthew,19,8,Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.,10
Matthew,19,9,"And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.",2
Matthew,19,11,"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.",10
Matthew,19,12,"For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake.",10
Matthew,19,12,"He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.",13
Matthew,19,14,"Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.",22

Matthew,19,18,"Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,",46
Matthew,19,19,"Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.",46
Matthew,19,21,"If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.",17
Matthew,19,23,"Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.",2
Matthew,19,24,"And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.",22
Matthew,19,26,With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.,43
Matthew,19,28,"Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.",2
Matthew,19,29,"And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life.",20
Matthew,19,30,But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.,43
Matthew,20,1,"For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.",22
Matthew,20,2,"And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.",47
Matthew,20,3,"And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,",47
Matthew,20,4,"And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you.",30
Matthew,20,4,And they went their way.,47
Matthew,20,5,"Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise.",47
Matthew,20,6,"And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?",47
Matthew,20,7,"They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us.",47
Matthew,20,7,"He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive.",30
Matthew,20,8,"So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.",47
Matthew,20,9,"And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.",47
Matthew,20,10,"But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.",47
Matthew,20,11,"And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,",47
Matthew,20,12,"Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day.",17
Matthew,20,13,"But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?",17
Matthew,20,14,"Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee.",17
Matthew,20,15,Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?,20
Matthew,20,15,"Is thine eye evil, because I am good?",33
Matthew,20,16,"So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.",43
Matthew,20,18,"Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,",5
Matthew,20,19,"And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.",47
Matthew,20,21,What wilt thou?,17
Matthew,20,22,Ye know not what ye ask.,30
Matthew,20,22,"Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?",34
Matthew,20,23,"Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.",34
Matthew,20,25,"Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them.",43
Matthew,20,26,"But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;",13
Matthew,20,27,"And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:",13
Matthew,20,28,"Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.",5
Matthew,20,32,What will ye that I shall do unto you?,30

Luke,7,32,"They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.",30
Luke,7,33,"For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.",47
Luke,7,34,"The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!",5

Luke,8,14,"And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.",43

Luke,11,5,"Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go unto him at midnight, and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;",47

Luke,11,29,"This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.",45

Luke,11,43,"Woe unto you, Pharisees!",6
Luke,11,43,"for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.",10
Luke,11,44,"Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!",21
Luke,11,44,"for ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.",43
Luke,11,46,"Woe unto you also, ye lawyers!",6
Luke,11,46,"for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.",10

Luke,11,49,"Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:",47

Luke,12,11,"And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer, or what ye shall say:",30

Luke,12,14,"Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?",20
Luke,12,15,"Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.",10

Luke,12,19,"And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.",17
Luke,12,20,"But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?",17
Luke,12,21,"So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.",10
Luke,12,22,"Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.",2
Luke,12,23,"The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.",10
Luke,12,24,Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?,43

Luke,12,29,"And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind.",30
Luke,12,30,For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.,1

Luke,12,32,"Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.",10
Luke,12,33,"Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.",10

Luke,12,47,"And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.",47
Luke,12,48,"But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes.",10

Luke,12,56,"Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?",20
Luke,12,57,"Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?",3
Luke,12,58,"When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.",17

Luke,13,12,"Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.",17
Luke,13,15,"The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?",47

Luke,13,18,Unto what is the kingdom of God like?,22
Luke,13,18,and whereunto shall I resemble it?,20
Luke,13,19,"It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.",47
Luke,13,20,Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?,22
Luke,13,21,"It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.",10
Luke,13,24,"Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.",2
Luke,13,25,"When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:",8

Luke,15,6,"And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost.",47
Luke,15,7,"I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance.",2
Luke,15,8,"Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?",47
Luke,15,9,"And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost.",47

Luke,15,13,"And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living.",47
Luke,15,14,"And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.",47
Luke,15,15,And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.,47
Luke,15,16,And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.,47
Luke,15,17,"And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!",47
Luke,15,18,"I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,",38
Luke,15,19,And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.,47
Luke,15,20,"And he arose, and came to his father.",47
Luke,15,20,"But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.",47

Luke,15,22,"But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:",47
Luke,15,23,"And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:",13
Luke,15,24,"For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.",47
Luke,15,24,And they began to be merry.,47
Luke,15,25,"Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.",47
Luke,15,26,"And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.",47
Luke,15,27,"And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.",47
Luke,15,28,"And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.",47

Luke,16,1,"There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.",47
Luke,16,2,"And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee?",20
Luke,16,2,give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.,10
Luke,16,3,"Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do?",20
Luke,16,3,for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.,10
Luke,16,4,"I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.",34

Luke,16,24,"And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.",38
Luke,16,25,"But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.",17
Luke,16,26,"And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.",10
Luke,16,27,"Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:",17

Luke,24,17,"What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?",30
Luke,24,19,What things?,1
Luke,24,25,"O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:",10
Luke,24,26,"Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?",1
Luke,24,36,Peace be unto you.,9
Luke,24,38,Why are ye troubled?,3
Luke,24,38,and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?,3

John,1,38,What seek ye?,3
John,1,39,Come and see.,47
John,1,42,Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called Cephas.,17
John,1,43,Follow me.,14
John,1,47,"Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!",10
John,1,48,"Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.",17
John,1,50,"Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou?",17
John,1,50,thou shalt see greater things than these.,17
John,1,51,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.",18
John,2,4,"Woman, what have I to do with thee?",20

John,3,13,"And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.",39
John,3,14,"And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:",5
John,3,15,"That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.",10
John,3,16,"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.",33
John,3,17,For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.,33
John,3,18,"He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.",11
John,3,19,"And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.",33
John,3,20,"For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.",10

John,4,16,"Go, call thy husband, and come hither.",47
John,4,17,"Thou hast well said, I have no husband:",17
John,4,18,For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.,17
John,4,21,"Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.",38
John,4,22,Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.,30
John,4,23,"But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.",38
John,4,24,God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.,47
John,4,26,I that speak unto thee am he.,34
John,4,32,I have meat to eat that ye know not of.,30

John,5,14,"Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.",17
John,5,17,"My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.",38
John,5,19,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.",18
John,5,20,"For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.",38
John,5,21,"For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.",38
John,5,22,"For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:",38
John,5,23,"That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father.",38
John,5,23,He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.,38
John,5,24,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.",18
John,5,25,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.",18
John,5,26,For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;,38
John,5,27,"And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.",5
John,5,28,"Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,",10
John,5,29,"And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.",47
John,5,30,"I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.",38
John,5,31,"If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.",10
John,5,32,There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.,11
John,5,33,"Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.",47
John,5,34,"But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.",1
John,5,35,He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.,47
John,5,36,"But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.",38
John,5,37,"And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me.",38
John,5,37,"Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.",10
John,5,38,"And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.",30
John,5,39,Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.,43
John,5,40,"And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.",30
John,5,41,I receive not honour from men.,10
John,5,42,"But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.",30
John,5,43,"I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.",30
John,5,44,"How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?",10
John,5,45,"Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.",38
John,5,46,"For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me; for he wrote of me.",30
John,5,47,"But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?",30
John,6,5,"Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?",20
John,6,10,Make the men sit down.,10
John,6,12,"Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.",10
John,6,20,It is I; be not afraid.,13
John,6,26,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of the loaves, and were filled.",18
John,6,27,"Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.",5
John,6,29,"This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.",10
John,6,32,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven.",18
John,6,33,"For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.",33
John,6,35,I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst.,11
John,6,36,"But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not.",30
John,6,37,All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.,38
John,6,38,"For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.",11
John,6,39,"And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day.",38
John,6,40,"And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.",11
John,6,43,Murmur not among yourselves.,10
John,6,44,"No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.",38
John,6,45,"It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God.",10
John,6,45,"Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me.",38
John,6,46,"Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the Father.",38
John,6,47,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath everlasting life.",18
John,6,48,I am that bread of life.,34
John,6,49,"Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.",10
John,6,50,"This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof, and not die.",10
John,6,51,"I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.",33
John,6,53,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.",18
John,6,54,"Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.",38
John,6,55,"For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.",10
John,6,56,"He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.",38
John,6,57,"As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.",38
John,6,58,"This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.",10
John,6,61,Doth this offend you?,20
John,6,62,What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?,5
John,6,63,"It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing: the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life.",43
John,6,64,But there are some of you that believe not.,43
John,6,65,"Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.",38
John,6,67,Will ye also go away?,3
John,6,70,"Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?",20
John,7,6,My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.,10
John,7,7,"The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.",33
John,7,8,Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come.,10
John,7,16,"My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.",11
John,7,17,"If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.",20
John,7,18,"He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.",11
John,7,19,"Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?",10
John,7,19,Why go ye about to kill me?,3
John,7,21,"I have done one work, and ye all marvel.",30
John,7,22,"Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.",44
John,7,23,"If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?",44
John,7,24,"Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.",10
John,7,28,"Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.",11
John,7,29,"But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.",11
John,7,33,"Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.",11
John,7,34,"Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.",30
John,7,37,"If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.",13
John,7,38,"He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.",11
John,8,7,"He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.",13
John,8,10,"Woman, where are those thine accusers?",43
John,8,10,hath no man condemned thee?,20
John,8,11,"Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.",10
John,8,12,"I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.",33
John,8,14,"Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.",30
John,8,15,Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.,10
John,8,16,"And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.",11
John,8,17,"It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.",10
John,8,18,"I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.",11
John,8,19,"Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.",38
John,8,21,"I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.",30
John,8,23,Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.,33
John,8,24,"I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.",30
John,8,25,Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.,10
John,8,26,I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.,11
John,8,28,"When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.",38
John,8,29,And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.,11
John,8,31,"If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;",30
John,8,32,"And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.",30
John,8,34,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.",18
John,8,35,And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.,10
John,8,36,"If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.",30
John,8,37,"I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.",30
John,8,38,I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.,38
John,8,39,"If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.",30
John,8,40,"But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.",30
John,8,41,Ye do the deeds of your father.,10
John,8,42,"If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.",38
John,8,43,Why do ye not understand my speech?,3
John,8,43,even because ye cannot hear my word.,10
John,8,44,"Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do.",10
John,8,44,"He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.",10
John,8,44,"When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.",47
John,8,45,"And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.",30
John,8,46,Which of you convinceth me of sin?,10
John,8,46,"And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?",3
John,8,47,"He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.",43
John,8,49,"I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.",38
John,8,50,And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.,10
John,8,51,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.",18
John,8,54,"If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:",38
John,8,55,"Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.",30
John,8,56,"Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.",47
John,8,58,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.",18
John,9,3,"Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.",10
John,9,4,"I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.",11
John,9,5,"As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.",33
John,9,7,"Go, wash in the pool of Siloam.",10
John,9,35,Dost thou believe on the Son of God?,5
John,9,37,"Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.",17
John,9,39,"For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.",33
John,9,41,"If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.",30
John,10,1,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.",18
John,10,2,But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.,10
John,10,3,"To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.",47
John,10,4,"And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.",47
John,10,5,"And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.",43
John,10,7,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.",18
John,10,8,All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.,10
John,10,9,"I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.",47
John,10,10,"The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.",47
John,10,11,I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.,34
John,10,12,"But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.",10
John,10,13,"The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.",10
John,10,14,"I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.",34
John,10,15,"As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.",38
John,10,16,"And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.",43
John,10,17,"Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.",38
John,10,18,"No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself.",38
John,10,18,"I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.",47
John,10,18,This commandment have I received of my Father.,38
John,10,25,"I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.",38
John,10,26,"But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.",30
John,10,27,"My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:",38
John,10,28,"And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.",47
John,10,29,"My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.",38
John,10,30,I and my Father are one.,38
John,10,32,Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?,38
John,10,34,"Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?",20
John,10,35,"If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;",47
John,10,36,"Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?",33
John,10,37,"If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.",38
John,10,38,"But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.",38
John,11,4,"This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.",5
John,11,9,Are there not twelve hours in the day?,10
John,11,9,"If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.",33
John,11,10,"But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him.",10
John,11,11,"Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.",10
John,11,14,Lazarus is dead.,10
John,11,15,"And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.",10
John,11,23,Thy brother shall rise again.,47
John,11,25,"I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:",34

John,11,26,Believest thou this?,17
John,11,34,Where have ye laid him?,3
John,11,39,Take ye away the stone.,10
John,11,40,"Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?",17
John,11,41,"Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.",17
John,11,42,"And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.",17
John,11,43,"Lazarus, come forth.",49
John,11,44,"Loose him, and let him go.",13
John,12,7,Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.,10

John,12,26,"If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.",13
John,12,27,Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?,20
John,12,27,"Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.",38

John,12,48,"He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.",11
John,12,49,"For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.",38
John,12,50,"And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.",38

John,14,10,"Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?",38
John,14,10,"the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.",38
John,14,11,"Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.",38
John,14,12,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.",18
John,14,13,"And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.",38
John,14,14,"If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.",30
John,14,15,"If ye love me, keep my commandments.",30
John,14,16,"And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;",38

John,14,19,"Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.",30
John,14,20,"At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.",38
John,14,21,"He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.",38

John,14,28,"If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.",38
John,14,29,"And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.",30
John,14,30,"Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.",10
John,14,31,"But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do.",38

John,15,2,"Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.",49
John,15,3,Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.,30
John,15,4,"Abide in me, and I in you.",38
John,15,4,"As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.",10
John,15,5,"I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.",38
John,15,6,"If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.",47
John,15,7,"If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.",30
John,15,8,"Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.",30

John,15,11,"These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.",1
John,15,12,"This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.",30
John,15,13,"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.",10
John,15,14,"Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.",30
John,15,15,Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.,38
John,15,16,"Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.",30
John,15,17,"These things I command you, that ye love one another.",1
John,15,18,"If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.",30
John,15,19,"If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.",33
John,15,20,"Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord.",10
John,15,20,"If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.",10
John,15,21,"But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.",11
John,15,22,"If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.",47
John,15,23,He that hateth me hateth my Father also.,38
John,15,24,"If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.",47
John,15,25,"But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.",10
John,15,26,"But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:",38
John,15,27,"And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.",30
John,16,1,"These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.",1
John,16,2,"They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.",10
John,16,3,"And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.",1
John,16,4,"But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them.",1
John,16,4,"And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.",1
John,16,5,"But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?",11
John,16,6,"But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.",1
John,16,7,"Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.",30
John,16,8,"And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:",47
John,16,9,"Of sin, because they believe not on me;",10
John,16,10,"Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;",38
John,16,11,"Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.",33
John,16,12,"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.",2
John,16,13,"Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.",47
John,16,14,"He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.",47
John,16,15,"All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.",38
John,16,16,"A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.",30
John,16,19,"Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?",30
John,16,20,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.",18
John,16,21,"A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.",33
John,16,22,"And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.",30
John,16,23,And in that day ye shall ask me nothing.,30
John,16,23,"Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.",18
John,16,24,"Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.",30
John,16,25,"These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.",1
John,16,26,"At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:",38
John,16,27,"For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.",38
John,16,28,"I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.",33
John,16,31,Do ye now believe?,3
John,16,32,"Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.",38
John,16,33,"These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace.",1
John,16,33,In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.,33
John,17,1,"Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:",38
John,17,2,"As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.",17
John,17,3,"And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.",17
John,17,4,I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.,17
John,17,5,"And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.",17
John,17,6,"I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.",33
John,17,7,Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.,17
John,17,8,"For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.",17
John,17,9,"I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.",33
John,17,10,"And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.",43
John,17,11,"And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee.",33
John,17,11,"Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.",17
John,17,12,"While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.",33
John,17,13,"And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.",33
John,17,14,"I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.",33
John,17,15,"I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.",33
John,17,16,"They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.",33
John,17,17,Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.,10
John,17,18,"As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.",33
John,17,19,"And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.",10
John,17,20,"Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;",10
John,17,21,"That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.",17
John,17,22,"And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:",17
John,17,23,"I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.",17
John,17,24,"Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.",17
John,17,25,"O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.",17
John,17,26,"And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.",17
John,18,4,Whom seek ye?,3
John,18,5,I am he.,34
John,18,6,I am he.,34
John,18,7,Whom seek ye?,3
John,18,8,"I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way:",34
John,18,11,"Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?",38
John,18,20,"I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.",10
John,18,21,Why askest thou me?,3
