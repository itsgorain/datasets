Luke,2,49,"How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father's business?"
Luke,4,4,"It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God."
Luke,4,8,"Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve."
Luke,4,12,"It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."
Luke,4,18,"The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,"
Luke,4,19,To preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
Luke,4,21,"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears."
Luke,4,23,"Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country."
Luke,4,24,"Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country."
Luke,4,25,"But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land;"
Luke,4,26,"But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow."
Luke,4,27,"And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian."
Luke,4,35,"Hold thy peace, and come out of him."
Luke,4,43,"I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent."
Luke,5,4,"Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught."
Luke,5,10,"Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men."
Luke,5,13,"I will: be thou clean."
Luke,5,14,"but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them."
Luke,5,20,"Man, thy sins are forgiven thee."
Luke,5,22,"What reason ye in your hearts?"
Luke,5,23,"Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk?"
Luke,5,24,"But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house."
Luke,5,27,"Follow me."
Luke,5,31,"They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick."
Luke,5,32,"I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."
Luke,5,34,"Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?"
Luke,5,35,"But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days."
Luke,5,36,"No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old."
Luke,5,37,"And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish."
Luke,5,38,But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved.
Luke,5,39,"No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better."
Luke,6,3,"Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with him;"
Luke,6,4,"How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?"
Luke,6,5,"That the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath."
Luke,6,8,"Rise up, and stand forth in the midst."
Luke,6,9,"I will ask you one thing; Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it?"
Luke,6,10,"Stretch forth thy hand."
Luke,6,20,"Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God."
Luke,6,21,Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.
Luke,6,22,"Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake."
Luke,6,23,"Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets."
Luke,6,24,But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.
Luke,6,25,Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.
Luke,6,26,"Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets."
Luke,6,27,"But I say unto you which hear, Love your enemies, do good to them which hate you,"
Luke,6,28,"Bless them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you."
Luke,6,29,And unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also.
Luke,6,30,Give to every man that asketh of thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.
Luke,6,31,"And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise."
Luke,6,32,"For if ye love them which love you, what thank have ye? for sinners also love those that love them."
Luke,6,33,"And if ye do good to them which do good to you, what thank have ye? for sinners also do even the same."
Luke,6,34,"And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? for sinners also lend to sinners, to receive as much again."
Luke,6,35,"But love ye your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be the children of the Highest: for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil."
Luke,6,36,"Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful."
Luke,6,37,"Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: forgive, and ye shall be forgiven:"
Luke,6,38,"Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again."
Luke,6,39,"Can the blind lead the blind? shall they not both fall into the ditch?"
Luke,6,40,The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.
Luke,6,41,"And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"
Luke,6,42,"Either how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother's eye."
Luke,6,43,For a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit; neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
Luke,6,44,"For every tree is known by his own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes."
Luke,6,45,A good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil: for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.
Luke,6,46,"And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?"
Luke,6,47,"Whosoever cometh to me, and heareth my sayings, and doeth them, I will shew you to whom he is like:"
Luke,6,48,"He is like a man which built an house, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a rock: and when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that house, and could not shake it: for it was founded upon a rock."
Luke,6,49,"But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great."
Luke,7,9,"I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel."
Luke,7,13,"Weep not."
Luke,7,14,"Young man, I say unto thee, Arise."
Luke,7,22,"Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached."
Luke,7,23,"And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me."
Luke,7,24,"What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?"
Luke,7,25,"But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings' courts."
Luke,7,26,"But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet."
Luke,7,27,"This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee."
Luke,7,28,"For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he."
Luke,7,31,"Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?"
Luke,7,32,"They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept."
Luke,7,33,"For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil."
Luke,7,34,"The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!"
Luke,7,35,But wisdom is justified of all her children.
Luke,7,40,"Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee."
Luke,7,41,"There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty."
Luke,7,42,"And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?"
Luke,7,43,"Thou hast rightly judged."
Luke,7,44,"Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head."
Luke,7,45,Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.
Luke,7,46,My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.
Luke,7,47,"Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little."
Luke,7,48,"Thy sins are forgiven."
Luke,7,50,"Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace."
Luke,8,5,"A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it."
Luke,8,6,"And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture."
Luke,8,7,"And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it."
Luke,8,8,"And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bare fruit an hundredfold. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."
Luke,8,10,"Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand."
Luke,8,11,Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
Luke,8,12,"Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved."
Luke,8,13,"They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away."
Luke,8,14,"And that which fell among thorns are they, which, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection."
Luke,8,15,"But that on the good ground are they, which in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience."
Luke,8,16,"No man, when he hath lighted a candle, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a candlestick, that they which enter in may see the light."
Luke,8,17,"For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad."
Luke,8,18,"Take heed therefore how ye hear: for whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have."

Luke,8,30,"What is thy name?"

Luke,8,46,"Somebody hath touched me: for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me."
Luke,8,48,"Daughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace."
Luke,8,50,"Fear not: believe only, and she shall be made whole."

Luke,9,23,"If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me."
Luke,9,24,"For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: but whosoever will lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it."
Luke,9,25,"For what is a man advantaged, if he gain the whole world, and lose himself, or be cast away?"
Luke,9,26,"For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels."
Luke,9,27,"But I tell you of a truth, there be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God."

Luke,10,7,"And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house."
Luke,10,8,"And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:"
Luke,10,9,"And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you."

Luke,11,12,"Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?"
Luke,11,13,"If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?"
Luke,11,17,"Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falleth."

Luke,11,49,"Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:"

Luke,12,1,"Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy."
Luke,12,2,"For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; neither hid, that shall not be known."

Luke,12,14,"Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?"
Luke,12,15,"Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth."
Luke,12,16,"And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully:"
Luke,12,17,"And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?"
Luke,12,18,"This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods."
Luke,12,19,"And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry."
Luke,12,20,"But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast provided?"
Luke,12,21,"So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God."
Luke,12,22,"Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on."
Luke,12,23,"The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment."
Luke,12,24,Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?
Luke,12,25,And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?
Luke,12,26,"If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?"
Luke,12,27,"Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these."
Luke,12,28,"If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?"
Luke,12,29,"And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, neither be ye of doubtful mind."
Luke,12,30,For all these things do the nations of the world seek after: and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.
Luke,12,31,But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things shall be added unto you.
Luke,12,32,"Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom."
Luke,12,33,"Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrupteth."
Luke,12,34,"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also."
Luke,12,35,"Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;"
Luke,12,36,"And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they may open unto him immediately."
Luke,12,37,"Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them."
Luke,12,38,"And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants."
Luke,12,39,"And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken through."
Luke,12,40,Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not.
Luke,12,42,"Who then is that faithful and wise steward, whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their portion of meat in due season?"
Luke,12,43,"Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing."
Luke,12,44,"Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all that he hath."
Luke,12,45,"But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat and drink, and to be drunken;"
Luke,12,46,"The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers."
Luke,12,47,"And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes."
Luke,12,48,"But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more."
Luke,12,49,"I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be already kindled?"
Luke,12,50,But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I straitened till it be accomplished!
Luke,12,51,"Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, Nay; but rather division:"
Luke,12,52,"For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three."
Luke,12,53,"The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in law against her mother in law."
Luke,12,54,"When ye see a cloud rise out of the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is."
Luke,12,55,"And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be heat; and it cometh to pass."
Luke,12,56,"Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?"
Luke,12,57,"Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?"
Luke,12,58,"When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him; lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison."
Luke,12,59,"I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the very last mite."
Luke,13,2,"Suppose ye that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?"
Luke,13,3,"I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish."
Luke,13,4,"Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem?"
Luke,13,5,"I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish."
Luke,13,6,"A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none."
Luke,13,7,"Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?"
Luke,13,8,"And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:"
Luke,13,9,"And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down."
Luke,13,12,"Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity."
Luke,13,15,"The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?"
Luke,13,16,"And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?"
Luke,13,18,"Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?"
Luke,13,19,"It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it."
Luke,13,20,"Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?"
Luke,13,21,"It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened."
Luke,13,24,"Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able."
Luke,13,25,"When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:"
Luke,13,26,"Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets."
Luke,13,27,"But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity."
Luke,13,28,"There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out."
Luke,13,29,"And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God."
Luke,13,30,"And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last."
Luke,13,32,"Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected."
Luke,13,33,"Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem."
Luke,13,34,"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not!"
Luke,13,35,"Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord."
Luke,14,3,"Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?"
Luke,14,5,"Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?"
Luke,14,8,"When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him;"
Luke,14,9,"And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room."
Luke,14,10,"But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee."
Luke,14,11,For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
Luke,14,12,"When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee."
Luke,14,13,"But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:"
Luke,14,14,And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.
Luke,14,16,"A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:"
Luke,14,17,"And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready."
Luke,14,18,"And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused."
Luke,14,19,"And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused."
Luke,14,20,"And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come."
Luke,14,21,"So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind."
Luke,14,22,"And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room."
Luke,14,23,"And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled."
Luke,14,24,"For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper."
Luke,14,26,"If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple."
Luke,14,27,"And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple."
Luke,14,28,"For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?"
Luke,14,29,"Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,"
Luke,14,30,"Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish."
Luke,14,31,"Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?"
Luke,14,32,"Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace."
Luke,14,33,"So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple."
Luke,14,34,"Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?"
Luke,14,35,"It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."
Luke,15,4,"What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it?"
Luke,15,5,"And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing."
Luke,15,6,"And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost."
Luke,15,7,"I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons, which need no repentance."
Luke,15,8,"Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently till she find it?"
Luke,15,9,"And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece which I had lost."
Luke,15,10,"Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth."
Luke,15,11,"A certain man had two sons:"
Luke,15,12,"And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his living."
Luke,15,13,"And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living."
Luke,15,14,"And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want."
Luke,15,15,And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
Luke,15,16,And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.
Luke,15,17,"And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!"
Luke,15,18,"I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,"
Luke,15,19,And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.
Luke,15,20,"And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him."
Luke,15,21,"And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son."
Luke,15,22,"But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:"
Luke,15,23,"And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry:"
Luke,15,24,"For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry."
Luke,15,25,"Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing."
Luke,15,26,"And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant."
Luke,15,27,"And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound."
Luke,15,28,"And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him."
Luke,15,29,"And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:"
Luke,15,30,"But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf."
Luke,15,31,"And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine."
Luke,15,32,"It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found."
Luke,16,1,"There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods."
Luke,16,2,"And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward."
Luke,16,3,"Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed."
Luke,16,4,"I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses."
Luke,16,5,"So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?"
Luke,16,6,"And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty."
Luke,16,7,"Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore."
Luke,16,8,"And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light."
Luke,16,9,"And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations."
Luke,16,10,He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.
Luke,16,11,"If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?"
Luke,16,12,"And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?"
Luke,16,13,"No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon."
Luke,16,15,"Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God."
Luke,16,16,"The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it."
Luke,16,17,"And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail."
Luke,16,18,"Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery."
Luke,16,19,"There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:"
Luke,16,20,"And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,"
Luke,16,21,And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
Luke,16,22,"And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;"
Luke,16,23,"And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom."
Luke,16,24,"And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame."
Luke,16,25,"But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented."
Luke,16,26,"And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence."
Luke,16,27,"Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:"
Luke,16,28,"For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment."
Luke,16,29,"Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them."
Luke,16,30,"And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent."
Luke,16,31,"And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead."
Luke,17,1,"It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe unto him, through whom they come!"
Luke,17,2,"It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones."
Luke,17,3,"Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him."
Luke,17,4,"And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him."
Luke,17,6,"If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you."
Luke,17,7,"But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?"
Luke,17,8,"And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?"
Luke,17,9,Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.
Luke,17,10,"So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do."
Luke,17,14,"Go shew yourselves unto the priests."
Luke,17,17,"Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?"
Luke,17,18,"There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger."
Luke,17,19,"Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole."
Luke,17,20,"The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:"
Luke,17,21,"Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you."
Luke,17,22,"The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it."
Luke,17,23,"And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them."
Luke,17,24,"For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day."
Luke,17,25,"But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation."
Luke,17,26,"And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man."
Luke,17,27,"They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all."
Luke,17,28,"Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;"
Luke,17,29,"But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all."
Luke,17,30,Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.
Luke,17,31,"In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back."
Luke,17,32,Remember Lot's wife.
Luke,17,33,Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.

Luke,17,36,"Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left."
Luke,17,37,"Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together."
Luke,18,2,"There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:"
Luke,18,3,"And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary."
Luke,18,4,"And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;"
Luke,18,5,"Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me."
Luke,18,6,"Hear what the unjust judge saith."
Luke,18,7,"And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?"
Luke,18,8,"I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?"
Luke,18,10,"Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican."
Luke,18,11,"The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican."
Luke,18,12,"I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess."
Luke,18,13,"And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner."
Luke,18,14,"I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted."
Luke,18,16,"Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God."
Luke,18,17,"Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein."
Luke,18,19,"Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God."
Luke,18,20,"Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother."
Luke,18,22,"Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me."
Luke,18,24,"How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!"
Luke,18,25,"For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
Luke,18,27,"The things which are impossible with men are possible with God."
Luke,18,29,"Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,"
Luke,18,30,"Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting."
Luke,18,31,"Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished."

Luke,19,9,"This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham."
Luke,19,10,For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
Luke,19,12,"A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return."
Luke,19,13,"And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come."
Luke,19,14,"But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us."
Luke,19,15,"And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading."
Luke,19,16,"Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds."
Luke,19,17,"And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities."
Luke,19,18,"And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds."
Luke,19,19,"And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities."
Luke,19,20,"And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:"

Luke,20,11,"And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty."
Luke,20,12,"And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out."
