Mark,12,34,"Thou art not far from the kingdom of God."
Mark,12,35,"How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?"
Mark,12,36,"For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool."
Mark,12,37,"David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son?"
Mark,12,38,"Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,"
Mark,12,39,"And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:"

Mark,13,21,"And then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here is Christ; or, lo, he is there; believe him not:"
Mark,13,22,"For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect."
Mark,13,23,"But take ye heed: behold, I have foretold you all things."
Mark,13,24,"But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,"
Mark,13,25,"And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken."
Mark,13,26,And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
Mark,13,27,"And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven."
Mark,13,28,"Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is near:"
Mark,13,29,"So ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is nigh, even at the doors."
Mark,13,30,"Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done."
Mark,13,31,Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.
Mark,13,32,"But of that day and that hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father."
Mark,13,33,"Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is."
Mark,13,34,"For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch."
Mark,13,35,"Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at the cockcrowing, or in the morning:"
