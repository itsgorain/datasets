Mark,12,27,"He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err."
Mark,12,29,"And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:"
Mark,12,30,"And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment."
Mark,12,31,"And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these."
Mark,12,34,"And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him any question."
Mark,12,35,"And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?"
Mark,12,36,"For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool."
Mark,12,37,David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.
Mark,12,38,"And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,"
