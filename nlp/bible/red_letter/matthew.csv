Matthew,12,32,"And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come."
Matthew,12,33,"Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit."
Matthew,12,34,"O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh."
Matthew,12,35,A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.
Matthew,12,36,"But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment."
Matthew,12,37,"For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned."
Matthew,12,39,"But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:"
Matthew,12,40,For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
Matthew,12,41,"The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here."
Matthew,12,42,"The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here."
Matthew,12,43,"When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none."
Matthew,12,44,"Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished."
Matthew,12,45,"Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation."
Matthew,12,48,"But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?"
Matthew,12,49,"And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!"
Matthew,12,50,"For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother."
Matthew,13,3,"And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;"
Matthew,13,4,"And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:"
Matthew,13,5,"Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:"
Matthew,13,6,"And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away."
Matthew,13,7,"And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:"
Matthew,13,8,"But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold."
Matthew,13,9,"Who hath ears to hear, let him hear."
Matthew,13,11,"He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given."
Matthew,13,12,"For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath."
Matthew,13,13,"Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand."
Matthew,13,14,"And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:"
Matthew,13,15,"For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them."
Matthew,13,16,"But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear."
Matthew,13,17,"For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them."
Matthew,13,18,Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
Matthew,13,19,"When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side."
Matthew,13,20,"But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;"
Matthew,13,21,"Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended."
Matthew,13,22,"He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful."
Matthew,13,23,"But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty."
Matthew,13,24,"Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field:"
Matthew,13,25,"But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way."
Matthew,13,26,"But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also."
Matthew,13,27,"So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?"
Matthew,13,28,"He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?"
Matthew,13,29,"But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them."
Matthew,13,30,"Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my barn."
Matthew,13,31,"Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field:"
Matthew,13,32,"Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof."
Matthew,13,33,"Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened."
Matthew,13,37,"He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man;"
Matthew,13,38,The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;
Matthew,13,39,The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
Matthew,13,40,As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
Matthew,13,41,"The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;"
Matthew,13,42,And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew,13,43,"Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear."
Matthew,13,44,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field."
Matthew,13,45,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:"
Matthew,13,46,"Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it."
Matthew,13,47,"Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:"
Matthew,13,48,"Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away."
Matthew,13,49,"So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,"
Matthew,13,50,And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Matthew,13,51,"Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea, Lord."
Matthew,13,52,"Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old."
Matthew,13,57,"And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house."
Matthew,13,58,And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
Matthew,14,16,"But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat."
Matthew,14,18,"He said, Bring them hither to me."
Matthew,14,27,"But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid."
Matthew,14,29,"And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus."
Matthew,14,31,"And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?"
Matthew,15,3,"But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?"
Matthew,15,4,"For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death."
Matthew,15,5,"But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;"
Matthew,15,6,"And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition."
Matthew,15,7,"Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,"
Matthew,15,8,"This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me."
Matthew,15,9,"But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men."
Matthew,15,10,"And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:"
Matthew,15,11,"Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man."
Matthew,15,13,"But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up."
Matthew,15,14,"Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch."
Matthew,15,16,"And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?"
Matthew,15,17,"Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?"
Matthew,15,18,But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.
Matthew,15,19,"For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:"
Matthew,15,20,These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.
Matthew,15,24,"But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel."
Matthew,15,26,"But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs."
Matthew,15,28,"Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour."
Matthew,15,32,"Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way."
Matthew,15,34,"And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes."
Matthew,16,2,"He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red."
Matthew,16,3,"And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?"
Matthew,16,4,"A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed."
Matthew,16,6,"Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees."
Matthew,16,8,"Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no bread?"
Matthew,16,9,"Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?"
Matthew,16,10,"Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?"
Matthew,16,11,"How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?"
Matthew,16,13,"When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?"
Matthew,16,15,"He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?"
Matthew,16,17,"And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven."
Matthew,16,18,"And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."
Matthew,16,19,And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
Matthew,16,23,"But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan: thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men."
Matthew,16,24,"Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me."
Matthew,16,25,For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.
Matthew,16,26,"For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?"
Matthew,16,27,For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.
Matthew,16,28,"Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom."
Matthew,17,7,"And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid."
Matthew,17,9,"And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead."
Matthew,17,11,"And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things."
Matthew,17,12,"But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them."
Matthew,17,17,"Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me."
Matthew,17,20,"And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you."
Matthew,17,21,Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.
Matthew,17,22,"And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:"
Matthew,17,23,"And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry."
Matthew,17,25,"He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of strangers?"
Matthew,17,26,"Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then are the children free."
Matthew,17,27,"Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee."
Matthew,18,3,"And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,18,4,"Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,18,5,And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.
Matthew,18,6,"But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea."
Matthew,18,7,Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!
Matthew,18,8,"Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire."
Matthew,18,9,"And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire."
Matthew,18,10,"Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven."
Matthew,18,11,For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
Matthew,18,12,"How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?"
Matthew,18,13,"And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray."
Matthew,18,14,"Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish."
Matthew,18,15,"Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother."
Matthew,18,16,"But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established."
Matthew,18,17,"And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican."
Matthew,18,18,"Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."
Matthew,18,19,"Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven."
Matthew,18,20,"For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them."
Matthew,18,22,"Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven."
Matthew,18,23,"Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king, which would take account of his servants."
Matthew,18,24,"And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which owed him ten thousand talents."
Matthew,18,25,"But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made."
Matthew,18,26,"The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all."
Matthew,18,27,"Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt."
Matthew,18,28,"But the same servant went out, and found one of his fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest."
Matthew,18,29,"And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all."
Matthew,18,30,"And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he should pay the debt."
Matthew,18,31,"So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done."
Matthew,18,32,"Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou desiredst me:"
Matthew,18,33,"Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?"
Matthew,18,34,"And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all that was due unto him."
Matthew,18,35,"So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses."
Matthew,19,4,"And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,"
Matthew,19,5,"And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?"
Matthew,19,6,"Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder."
Matthew,19,8,"He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so."
Matthew,19,9,"And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery."
Matthew,19,11,"But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given."
Matthew,19,12,"For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it."
Matthew,19,14,"But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,19,17,"And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments."
Matthew,19,18,"He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,"
Matthew,19,19,"Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
Matthew,19,21,"Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me."
Matthew,19,23,"Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven."
Matthew,19,24,"And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."
Matthew,19,26,"But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible."
Matthew,19,28,"And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
Matthew,19,29,"And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit everlasting life."
Matthew,19,30,But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.
Matthew,20,1,"For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard."
Matthew,20,2,"And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard."
Matthew,20,3,"And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing idle in the marketplace,"
Matthew,20,4,"And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way."
Matthew,20,5,"Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did likewise."
Matthew,20,6,"And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?"
Matthew,20,7,"They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that shall ye receive."
Matthew,20,8,"So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first."
Matthew,20,9,"And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny."
Matthew,20,10,"But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more; and they likewise received every man a penny."
Matthew,20,11,"And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman of the house,"
Matthew,20,12,"Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat of the day."
Matthew,20,13,"But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?"
Matthew,20,14,"Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto thee."
Matthew,20,15,"Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, because I am good?"
Matthew,20,16,"So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen."
Matthew,20,18,"Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,"
Matthew,20,19,"And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again."
Matthew,20,21,"And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom."
Matthew,20,22,"But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able."
Matthew,20,23,"And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my Father."
Matthew,20,25,"But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority upon them."
Matthew,20,26,"But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;"
Matthew,20,27,"And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:"
Matthew,20,28,"Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many."
Matthew,20,32,"And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I shall do unto you?"
Matthew,21,2,"Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me."
Matthew,21,3,"And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway he will send them."
Matthew,21,13,"And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves."
Matthew,21,16,"And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?"
Matthew,21,19,"And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away."
Matthew,21,21,"Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it shall be done."
